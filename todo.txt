Planned
- Make better descriptions for good leader forward
- Add validations for the number inputs for non-numerical inputs and out of bounds inputs
- Consider refactoring the character creation function - it's kind of ugly
- Consider refactoring the index of function to only return the top level index and using that in the formulas instead

Possible
- Add Copy/Paste Button functionality
	- Add button to jquery functionality
	- Add code to copy element to clipboard - turns out this is easier said than done.  Need flash or that weird ctrl keydown trick.  Probably not worth it.
- Add Edit functionality to swap out traits for one another
